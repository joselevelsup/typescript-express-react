# TERM Stack (Typescript, Express, React, MongoDB)

This Repository utilizes Typescript as the Programming Language, Express for the Server Side library, React for the Front End, and MongoDB for Database

Server: Contains all the source files for the Server

Client: Contians the React Application

bin: Contains the file needed to Run the Server

To Run this application, follow the steps in order:
1. `git clone https://github.com/joselevelsup/typescript-express-react`
2. `cd` into the project folder and type in `npm install`
3. `cd` in the `client` folder and do another `npm install`
4. To test: 

    - Make sure you are in the root project directory
    - type `npm run app:start`, This will run the app in its Development environment
5. To build for Production:

    - Make sure you are in the root project directory
    - type `npm run app:prod`, This will run the app in its Production environment

6. That's it! Happy Coding!
